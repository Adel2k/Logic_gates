# Verilog Solutions – *Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog (3rd Edition)*  

This repository contains solutions to selected problems from the book *Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog (3rd Edition)*. Each problem is implemented in Verilog and follows a structured approach to digital circuit design.  

## 📁 Project Structure  

Each problem is stored in a separate file, named according to the problem number from the book. For example:  
```
├── 4_3.v     # Solution to problem 4.3  
├── 6_2.v     # Solution to problem 6.2  
├── Makefile  # Compilation and visualization automation  
```

## ⚙️ Usage  

The provided `Makefile` automates the simulation process:  

- **Compile and run** a solution:  
  ```sh
  make PROBLEM=<problem_number>
  ```
  Example for problem 4.3:  
  ```sh
  make PROBLEM=4_3
  ```

- **Generate and open the waveform** for visualization:  
  ```sh
  make visualize PROBLEM=<problem_number>
  ```
  Example:  
  ```sh
  make visualize PROBLEM=4_3
  ```  

## 🔍 Features  
✔ Organized problem-based solutions  
✔ Makefile automation for compilation and visualization  
✔ Waveform analysis using GTKWave (or your preferred tool)  

## 📌 Requirements  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Icarus Verilog** (`iverilog`) for compilation  
- **GTKWave** for waveform visualization
